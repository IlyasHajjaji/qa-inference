Prehistoric art
European prehistoric art is an important part of the European cultural heritage.[7]  Prehistoric art history is usually divided into four main periods: Stone Age, Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Most of the remaining artifacts of this period are small sculptures and cave paintings.


Ancient
The Minoan civilization of Crete is regarded as the oldest civilization in Europe.[15] Minoan art is marked by imaginative images and exceptional workmanship.  Sinclair Hood described an ""essential quality of the finest Minoan art, the ability to create an atmosphere of movement and life although following a set of highly formal conventions"".[16]  It forms part of the wider grouping of Aegean art, and in later periods came for a time to have a dominant influence over Cycladic art.  Wood and textiles have decomposed, so most surviving examples of Minoan art are pottery, intricately-carved Minoan seals, .palace frescos which include landscapes), small sculptures in various materials, jewellery, and metalwork. 


Medieval
Most surviving art from the Medieval period was religious in focus, often funded by the Church, powerful ecclesiastical individuals such as bishops, communal groups such as abbeys, or wealthy secular patrons. Many had specific liturgical functions—processional crosses and altarpieces, for example.


Renaissance
The Renaissance is characterized by a focus on the arts of Ancient Greece and Rome, which led to many changes in both the technical aspects of painting and sculpture, as well as to their subject matter. It began in Italy, a country rich in Roman heritage as well as material prosperity to fund artists. During the Renaissance, painters began to enhance the realism of their work by using new techniques in perspective, thus representing three dimensions more authentically. Artists also began to use new techniques in the manipulation of light and darkness, such as the tone contrast evident in many of Titian's portraits and the development of sfumato and chiaroscuro by Leonardo da Vinci. Sculptors, too, began to rediscover many ancient techniques such as contrapposto. Following with the humanist spirit of the age, art became more secular in subject matter, depicting ancient mythology in addition to Christian themes. This genre of art is often referred to as Renaissance Classicism. In the North, the most important Renaissance innovation was the widespread use of oil paints, which allowed for greater colour and intensity.


Mannerism, Baroque, and Rococo
In European art, Renaissance Classicism spawned two different movements—Mannerism and the Baroque. Mannerism, a reaction against the idealist perfection of Classicism, employed distortion of light and spatial frameworks in order to emphasize the emotional content of a painting and the emotions of the painter. The work of El Greco is a particularly clear example of Mannerism in painting during the late 16th, early 17th centuries. Northern Mannerism took longer to develop, and was largely a movement of the last half of the 16th century. Baroque art took the representationalism of the Renaissance to new heights, emphasizing detail, movement, lighting, and drama in their search for beauty. Perhaps the best known Baroque painters are Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens, and Diego Velázquez.


Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Academism, and Realism
Throughout the 18th century, a counter movement opposing the Rococo sprang up in different parts of Europe, commonly known as Neoclassicism. It despised the perceived superficiality and frivolity of Rococo art, and desired for a return to the simplicity, order and 'purism' of classical antiquity, especially ancient Greece and Rome. The movement was in part also influenced by the Renaissance, which itself was strongly influenced by classical art. Neoclassicism was the artistic component of the intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment; the Enlightenment was idealistic, and put its emphasis on objectivity, reason and empirical truth. Neoclassicism had become widespread in Europe throughout the 18th century, especially in the United Kingdom, which saw great works of Neoclassical architecture spring up during this period; Neoclassicism's fascination with classical antiquity can be seen in the popularity of the Grand Tour during this decade, where wealthy aristocrats travelled to the ancient ruins of Italy and Greece. Nevertheless, a defining moment for Neoclassicism came during the French Revolution in the late 18th century; in France, Rococo art was replaced with the preferred Neoclassical art, which was seen as more serious than the former movement. In many ways, Neoclassicism can be seen as a political movement as well as an artistic and cultural one.[37] Neoclassical art places an emphasis on order, symmetry and classical simplicity; common themes in Neoclassical art include courage and war, as were commonly explored in ancient Greek and Roman art. Ingres, Canova, and Jacques-Louis David are among the best-known neoclassicists.[38]


Modern art
Out of the naturalist ethic of Realism grew a major artistic movement, Impressionism. The Impressionists pioneered the use of light in painting as they attempted to capture light as seen from the human eye. Edgar Degas,
Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, were all involved in the Impressionist movement. As a direct outgrowth of Impressionism came the development of Post-Impressionism. Paul Cézanne, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat are the best known Post-Impressionists.


Contemporary art and Postmodern art
Modern art foreshadowed several characteristics of what would later be defined as postmodern art; as a matter of fact, several modern art movements can often be classified as both modern and postmodern, such as pop art. Postmodern art, for instance, places a strong emphasis on irony, parody and humour in general; modern art started to develop a more ironic approach to art which would later advance in a postmodern context. Postmodern art sees the blurring between the high and fine arts with low-end and commercial art; modern art started to experiment with this blurring.[39]
Recent developments in art have been characterised by a significant expansion of what can now deemed to be art, in terms of materials, media, activity and concept. Conceptual art in particular has had a wide influence. This started literally as the replacement of concept for a made object, one of the intentions of which was to refute the commodification of art. However, it now usually refers to an artwork where there is an object, but the main claim for the work is made for the thought process that has informed it",2.9584875106811523,"L%27Illustration_Europ%C3%A9enne, Art_of_Europe",0.5300486272721958

What is the primary purpose of differential tempering in blacksmithing, particularly for cutting instruments like knives and swords?","

Differential tempering is a process used in blacksmithing to achieve a specific combination of hardness and flexibility in cutting instruments like knives and swords. The primary purpose of differential tempering in blacksmithing is to create a blade with a hard, wear-resistant edge and a softer, more flexible spine or back.

In traditional blacksmithing, differential tempering is used to achieve this dual hardness by heating the blade in localized areas to reduce the hardness of the spine or back, while maintaining a high hardness at the edge. This process allows the blacksmith to create a blade that is both strong and durable, yet also resistant to cracking or shattering.

In the case of knives and swords, differential tempering is used to create a blade with a sharp, hard edge that can hold its shape and maintain its cutting ability, while the softer spine or back provides flexibility and shock absorption. This combination of hardness and flexibility is critical for a cutting instrument, as it allows the blade to withstand the rigors of use while maintaining its cutting effectiveness.

In summary, the primary purpose of differential tempering in blacksmithing is to create a cutting instrument with a hard, wear-resistant edge and a softer, more flexible spine or back, allowing the blade to maintain its cutting ability while withstanding","According to the context, The the primary purpose of differential tempering in blacksmithing, particularly for cutting instruments like knives and swords is </s>",0.2495625019073486,,0.7656752762954887

What is the primary function of the lesser palatine foramina in relation to the lesser palatine nerves and arteries?","

The primary function of the lesser palatine foramina is to provide a passage through the palatine bone for the lesser palatine nerves and arteries. This allows these nerves and arteries to reach the soft palate from above, facilitating the transmission of nerve signals and the supply of oxygenated blood to the soft palate.

In other words, the lesser palatine foramina act as a conduit or a channel that enables the lesser palatine nerves and arteries to traverse the palatine bone and access the soft palate. This is essential for the proper functioning of the soft palate, which plays a crucial role in swallowing, speech, and other oral functions.

By allowing the lesser palatine nerves and arteries to pass through, the lesser palatine foramina enable the transmission of sensory and motor signals to and from the soft palate, as well as the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues of the soft palate.

The men's individual pursuit at the 2008 Summer Olympics took place on August 16 at the Laoshan Velodrome. The pre-event favorite to win the gold medal was the defending Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins of Great Britain, who managed to retain the title, setting a new Olympic record in the preliminary round.[1]


Qualification
Eighteen cyclists qualified for this event. Bradley Wiggins (Great Britain), the defending Olympic champion, qualified for winning the individual pursuit at the 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships. Volodymyr Dyudya (Ukraine) qualified at the late 2007 UCI World Cup event in Sydney, winning the individual pursuit there. The qualifier by way of the UCI B World Championship was Alexandr Pliuschin (Moldova). Jenning Huizenga (Netherlands), Taylor Phinney (United States), Phillip Thuaux (Australia), Sergi Escobar Roure (Spain), Alexander Serov (Russia), and David O'Loughlin (Ireland) qualified based on UCI rankings. The rest of the field was formed by berths given to the ten nations that qualified in the team pursuit. This resulted in Great Britain, Australia, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine, and Russia each having two competitors in this event.


Competition format
The eighteen cyclists were matched into nine two-man heats. The riders start on opposite sides of the track from one another, held in place by a starting gate until the race begins. While the objective is ostensibly to catch the other rider on the track, victory is most commonly determined by the faster time to cover 4,000 meters. The winners of each individual heat did not matter in the preliminaries - it was instead the overall eight fastest times which would advance to the match round.


Schedule
All times are China standard time (UTC+8)

Contents



Background
Contestants were housed in the Paramour Mansion, and squared off in a singing contest featuring well-known rock songs. Each week, viewers voted for their favorite contestant. The three contestants with the fewest votes performed an INXS song the following night. The members of the band then decided which contestant would be sent home, with lead guitarist Tim Farriss invoking the show's catchphrase to the departing contestant, ""You're just not right for our band, INXS.""


Finals
Three contestants reached the finale: Mig Ayesa, Marty Casey, and J. D. Fortune. Fortune was considered by many the underdog of the three as he established a renegade image during the competition, while Casey was considered the favorite due to his popularity with voters. In the finale, Ayesa, Casey, and Fortune each selected a song that was performed previously on the show. Ayesa chose Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", Casey chose Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here"", and Fortune chose The Rolling Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"". Based on these performances, INXS eliminated Ayesa.


Original songs
During the competition, Casey and Fortune performed two original songs that became fan favorites. Both songs would receive multiple encores during the competition. Casey's original song was called ""Trees"" and was described by host Dave Navarro as a song that he could imagine being heard on the radio ""today"". In fact, the song received some radioplay as a result of its exposure on the show.


Top 15 finalists
The following is a list of songs performed by each finalist during the competition. The number represents the week in which the song was performed. Except for the second week, each week one finalist was asked to perform an encore performance of the song they performed the night before, noted as an ""Encore Performance"".


Elimination chart
The show spawned a soundtrack entitled A Night at the Mayan Theatre, containing the performance from each contestant from the premiere episode, as well as two bonus tracks of Jordis Unga performing ""The Man Who Sold the World"" and Mig Ayesa performing ""Baby, I Love Your Way"".

What advantages do Field-Reversed Configurations (FRCs) offer over tokamaks in terms of plasma confinement and size?","

Field-Reversed Configurations (FRCs) offer several advantages over tokamaks in terms of plasma confinement and size.

Firstly, FRCs have higher Beta values compared to tokamaks. Beta is a measure of the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure, and higher Beta values indicate that the plasma is more efficiently confined. This means that FRCs can achieve the same power output as tokamaks, but with a smaller volume of plasma. This is a significant advantage, as it would allow for the construction of smaller, more compact fusion reactors, which would be more cost-effective and easier to maintain.

Secondly, FRCs have good plasma stability. Plasma stability is crucial in fusion reactions, as instabilities can cause the plasma to lose its confinement and cool down, making it difficult to achieve and sustain the high temperatures needed for fusion reactions. FRCs have been shown to have good plasma stability, which is essential for achieving and sustaining the high temperatures and densities required for fusion reactions.

Overall, the advantages of FRCs over tokamaks in terms of plasma confinement and size are significant. Their higher Beta values and good plasma stability make them an attractive alternative to tokamaks, and they have the potential to play an important role in the","According to the context, The advantages do Field-Reversed Configurations (FRCs) offer over tokamaks in terms of plasma confinement and size is  software, hardware, systems, weapons compatibility, and structural enhancements",1.7626657485961914,"Fahrenheit, General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon",0.732006022879855

What geological feature near Hrad Vallis may have contributed to the formation of the channel?","

Based on the context provided, it is likely that the geological feature near Hrad Vallis that contributed to the formation of the channel is the presence of hot subsurface molten rock from the nearby volcano, Elysium Mons. When this molten rock came close to the water ice beneath the surface of Mars, it may have caused the ice to melt, producing large amounts of liquid water and mud. This process could have created a significant amount of fluid that flowed through the channel, carving out the landscape and shaping the Hrad Vallis feature.

The proximity of Hrad Vallis to Elysium Mons, a large volcano, suggests a strong connection between the two geological features. The heat generated by the volcano's subsurface activity could have played a crucial role in melting the ice and creating the conditions necessary for the formation of the channel. This process would have required the presence of water ice beneath the surface, which is consistent with the context provided.

Therefore, the geological feature near Hrad Vallis that may have contributed to the formation of the channel is the hot subsurface molten rock from Elysium Mons, which interacted with the water ice to produce the liquid water and mud that carved out the channel.","According to the context, The geological feature near Hrad Vallis may have contributed to the formation of the channel is  Elysium Mons",1.0318875312805176,"Hrad_Vallis, List_of_valles_on_Mars",0.731806820127578

What is the state of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) when it is dissolved in an aqueous solution, according to the provided context?","

According to the provided context, when hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is dissolved in an aqueous solution, it is partially ionized, meaning that it exists in an equilibrium between un-ionized molecules and constituent ions. This indicates that H2S is not fully dissociated into its constituent ions, but rather exists in a state where some of the molecules remain intact while others break down into ions.

In other words, in an aqueous solution, H2S exists in a dynamic equilibrium between its molecular form (H2S) and its ionic form (H+ and HS-), with the two forms constantly interconverting. This is characteristic of a weak electrolyte, which is a substance that only partially dissociates into ions when dissolved in a solvent, in this case, water.

Therefore, the state of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) when it is dissolved in an aqueous solution is partially ionized, with a mixture of molecular and ionic forms coexisting in equilibrium.","According to the context, The the state of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) when it is dissolved in an aqueous solution, according to the provided context is No  CONTEXT</s>",0.2689352035522461,,0.7074704655054677

What is the minimum number of queries required to achieve an envy-free division with n=2 agents in the problem of envy-free cake-cutting?","

With n=2 agents, an envy-free division can be achieved using a simple algorithm called ""divide and choose"". The algorithm works as follows:

1. One agent divides the cake into two pieces, and the other agent chooses the piece they prefer.
2. If the first agent's piece is not the same as the second agent's chosen piece, the first agent gets their original piece, and the second agent gets the other piece.

This algorithm requires only two queries:

1. The first agent evaluates the two pieces they cut.
2. The second agent evaluates the two pieces and chooses one.

Since the second agent's choice is based on their evaluation of the two pieces, we can say that the second query is actually two evaluations in one.

Therefore, the minimum number of queries required to achieve an envy-free division with n=2 agents is 2.","According to the context, The the minimum number of queries required to achieve an envy-free division with n=2 agents in the problem of envy-free cake-cutting is No  CONTEXT</s>",0.271472692489624,,0.6921118805842718

What role do student politicians play in Venezuelan society, and how does their influence compare to that of students in other countries?","

Student politicians in Venezuela play a significant and unique role in the country's society, wielding a substantial amount of influence that is unparalleled in many other countries. Unlike in many nations where student activism is often marginalized or relegated to the fringes of political discourse, in Venezuela, student politicians are a force to be reckoned with. They have a long history of shaping public opinion, driving social change, and even influencing national policies.

In Venezuela, student politicians have been instrumental in mobilizing public support for various causes, often using their activism as a springboard for future political careers. Many student leaders have gone on to become prominent lawmakers, ministers, and even presidents, illustrating the significant impact they can have on the country's political landscape. This phenomenon is partly due to the country's historical context, where student movements have played a crucial role in shaping the nation's political destiny.

Compared to other countries, the influence of student politicians in Venezuela is remarkable. In many nations, student activism is often limited to campus-based issues or specific causes, without necessarily translating into broader political clout. In contrast, Venezuelan student politicians have managed to transcend campus boundaries, engaging with national issues and shaping the country's political agenda.
