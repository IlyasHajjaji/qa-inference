How did the Marshall Islands receive the opportunity to send swimmers to the Olympics, according to the FINA Points System of 28 June 2021?","

According to the context, the Marshall Islands received a universality invitation from FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation, or International Swimming Federation) to send two top-ranked swimmers, one male and one female, to the Olympics. This invitation was based on the FINA Points System, which was in effect as of June 28, 2021.

What was the outcome of the Korean National Party's attempt to become an alternative party after the 1979 South Korean coup d'état?","

The Korean National Party's (KNP) attempt to become an alternative party after the 1979 South Korean coup d'état was unsuccessful. Despite being formed by former members of the Democratic Republican Party (DRP) and organizations such as the Yushin Jeongu Association, the KNP failed to secure the greatest number of seats due to accusations of financial corruption and subsequent punishment by the ruling regime. As a result, the KNP withered away after the 1985 legislative elections, and its adherents largely defected to the New Democratic Republican Party (NDRP) under Kim Jong-pil.", Communist Party of Kampuchea and later the Party of Democratic Kampuchea,3.9006402492523193,"Assassination_of_Park_Chung_Hee, Khmer_Rouge"

What is the result of breeding two mink Tonkinese cats, in terms of the coat color and pattern of their offspring?","

Breeding two mink Tonkinese cats will not usually yield a full litter of mink kittens. Instead, the offspring will have a mix of coat colors and patterns, as the mink pattern is the result of having one gene for the Burmese solid pattern and one for the Siamese pointed pattern. This means that the kittens may inherit either the solid pattern from the Burmese gene, the pointed pattern from the Siamese gene, or a combination of both, resulting in a variety of coat colors and patterns among the litter.", one gene for the Burmese solid pattern and one for the Siamese pointed pattern,3.5784974098205566,"Cat_coat_genetics, Tonkinese_cat"
