Sites
At the time of the Lombard invasion, Naples had a population of about 30,000-35,000. In 615, under Giovanni Consino, Naples rebelled for the first time against the Exarch of Ravenna, the emperor's plenipotentiary in Italy. In reply, the first form of duchy was created in 638 by the Exarch Isaac or Eleutherius (exarchic chronology is uncertain), but this official came from abroad and had to answer to the strategos of Sicily. At that time the Duchy of Naples controlled an area corresponding roughly to the present day Province of Naples, encompassing the area of Vesuvius, the Campi Flegrei, the Sorrentine peninsula, Giugliano, Aversa, Afragola, Nola and the islands of Ischia and Procida. Capri was later part of the duchy of Amalfi

Normans, Hohenstaufen, and Anjou
After a period of Norman rule, in 1189 the Kingdom of Sicily was in a succession dispute between Tancred, King of Sicily of an illegitimate birth and the Hohenstaufens, a German royal house,[29] as its Prince Henry had married Princess Constance the last legitimate heir to the Sicilian throne. In 1191 Henry invaded Sicily after being crowned as Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor and many cities surrendered, but Naples resisted him from May to August under the leadership of Richard, Count of Acerra, Nicholas of Ajello, Aligerno Cottone and Margaritus of Brindisi before the Germans suffered from disease and were forced to retreat. Conrad II, Duke of Bohemia and Philip I, Archbishop of Cologne died of disease during the siege. In light of this Tancred achieved another unexpected achievement that his contender Constance, now empress, was captured at Salerno while those cities surrendered to Germans resubmitted to Tancred. Tancred had the empress imprisoned at Castel dell'Ovo at Naples before her release in May 1192. In 1194 Henry started his second campaign upon the death of Tancred, but this time Aligerno surrendered without resistance, and finally Henry conquered Sicily, putting it under the rule of Hohenstaufens.


The Aragonese period
In 1442 Alfonso I conquered Naples after his victory against the last Angevin king, Rene, and made his triumphal entry into the city in February 1443. The new dynasty enhanced commerce by connecting Naples to the Iberian peninsula and made Naples a centre of the Italian Renaissance: artists who worked in Naples in this period include Francesco Laurana, Antonello da Messina, Jacopo Sannazzaro and Angelo Poliziano. The court also granted land holdings in the provinces to the nobility; this, however, had the effect of fragmenting the kingdom.

What is the primary purpose of differential tempering in blacksmithing, particularly for cutting instruments like knives and swords?","

Differential tempering is a process used in blacksmithing to achieve a specific combination of hardness and flexibility in cutting instruments like knives and swords. The primary purpose of differential tempering in blacksmithing is to create a blade with a hard, wear-resistant edge and a softer, more flexible spine or back.

In traditional blacksmithing, differential tempering is used to achieve this dual hardness by heating the blade in localized areas to reduce the hardness of the spine or back, while maintaining a high hardness at the edge. This process allows the blacksmith to create a blade that is both strong and durable, yet also resistant to cracking or shattering.

In the case of knives and swords, differential tempering is used to create a blade with a sharp, hard edge that can hold its shape and maintain its cutting ability, while the softer spine or back provides flexibility and shock absorption. This combination of hardness and flexibility is critical for a cutting instrument, as it allows the blade to withstand the rigors of use while maintaining its cutting effectiveness.

In summary, the primary purpose of differential tempering in blacksmithing is to create a cutting instrument with a hard, wear-resistant edge and a softer, more flexible spine or back, allowing the blade to maintain its cutting ability while withstanding","According to the context, The the primary purpose of differential tempering in blacksmithing, particularly for cutting instruments like knives and swords is  to increase its hardenability and to decrease softening under temperature",0.8256278038024902,"Tempering_(metallurgy), Differential_heat_treatment",0.7860980340592276

In other words, the lesser palatine foramina act as a conduit or a channel that enables the lesser palatine nerves and arteries to traverse the palatine bone and access the soft palate. This is essential for the proper functioning of the soft palate, which plays a crucial role in swallowing, speech, and other oral functions.

By allowing the lesser palatine nerves and arteries to pass through, the lesser palatine foramina enable the transmission of sensory and motor signals to and from the soft palate, as well as the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues of the soft palate.

History
Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams started singing together in church as children in Birmingham, Alabama. By their teenage years, they formed a doo-wop quartet in 1955 with Kell Osborne and Wiley Waller, naming themselves the Cavaliers.[10]


Sound
Following their first Motown hit, the group altered their style several times over the ensuing years, adapting to the popular styles of the day while retaining their signature visual and vocal styles. The earliest Temptations recordings backed by Motown's stalwart studio band, the Funk Brothers, reflect the influence of producers Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson, and featured a cohesive blend of black rhythm and blues along with elements of white pop music that later came to be known as the Motown Sound. Recordings made prior to 1966, such as ""My Girl"", were built around songs with simple, direct lyrics supported by an R&B rhythm section with orchestral strings and horns added for pop appeal. During this period, each recording usually featured only one lead singer, usually David Ruffin or Eddie Kendricks, although Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, and Otis Williams each had solo numbers of their own at various times during this period.


Legacy and influence
Berry Gordy insisted that all his acts be equally appealing to both white as well as black audiences, and employed an extensive creative team to help tailor Motown talent for the crossover success he desired. Motown choreographer Cholly Atkins, along with Paul Williams, created the trademark precise and energetic, yet refined, dance steps used by the Temptations onstage. The most famous of these, the Temptation Walk, or Temptation Strut, was adapted from similar moves by the Flamingos and the Vibrations, from those two sources, Atkins and Williams crafted the resulting signature dance routine.

Reception
The MTV Video Music Awards have been described as a prominent event in the mainstream music industry since its inauguration. However, some publications such as The Washington Post and HuffPost opined that the stature of the ceremony had declined by 2019.[191][192] HuffPost cited reasons such as a lack of interest (declining attendances and viewership: in 2019 ratings hit an all-time low for the third straight year),[193] lack of musical diversity, lack of celebrity, lack of credibility,[192] and access to music online.[191] The Washington Post states, ""The moment the VMAs ceased to matter might have happened in 2014, when Drake didn't bother appearing to receive his award. Or maybe it was even earlier than that: The Associated Press compared the energy of the VMAs to the scripted reality-TV show Cribs all the way back in 2006.""[191] MTV has also faced criticism for devoting most of its airtime outside the VMAs to reality shows and dramas, with music videos mainly airing in off-peak graveyard slots to suffice the minimum amount of music programming in the network's carriage agreements.[192] However, the show's viewership began to grow again from 2021 through 2023.[194]

Sport psychology is defined as the study of the psychological basis, processes, and effects of sport.[1] Sport is defined as any physical activity where the individuals engage for competition and health.[2] Sport psychology is recognized as an interdisciplinary science that draws on knowledge from many related fields including biomechanics, physiology, kinesiology and psychology. It involves the study of how psychological factors affect performance and how participation in sport and exercise affect psychological and physical factors. Sport psychologists teach cognitive and behavioral strategies to athletes in order to improve their experience and performance in sports.


History of sport psychology
In its formation, sport psychology was primarily the domain of physical educators, not researchers, which can explain the lack of a consistent history.[5]  Nonetheless, many instructors sought to explain the various phenomena associated with physical activity and developed sport psychology laboratories.[citation needed]


Debate over the professionalization of sport psychology
Although the AASP has recently dealt with problems regarding the legal requirements for practicing sport psychology, there has been debate over the professionalization of sport psychology for quite some time. The professionalization of the discipline started to become visible at the Olympic games in 1984[35] when the Olympic teams began to hire sport psychologists for their athletes, and in 1985, when the U.S. team employed their first permanent sport psychologist. For the Summer Olympics in 1996, the U.S. already had over 20 sport psychologists working with their athletes. Psychological research into sport and exercise was being used to enhance the training regiments of high-level athletes for the first time.


Applied sport psychology today
Applied sport and exercise psychology consists of instructing athletes, coaches, teams, exercisers, parents, fitness professionals, groups, and other performers on the psychological aspects of their sport or activity. The goal of applied practice is to optimize performance and enjoyment through the use of psychological skills and the use of psychometrics and psychological assessment.[43] The practice of applied sport psychology is not legally restricted to individuals who possess one type of certification or licensure. The subject of ""what exactly constitutes applied sport psychology and who can practice it?"" has been debated amongst sport psychology professionals and to this day still lacks formal legal resolution in the United States. Some question the ability of professionals who possess only sport science or kinesiology training to practice ""psychology"" with clients, while others counter that clinical and counseling psychologists without training in sport science do not have the professional competency to work with athletes. However, this debate should not overshadow the reality that many professionals express the desire to work together to promote best practices among all practitioners, regardless of training or academic background.


Sport psychology: A repeatable process
The sport psychology consultation process can be overwhelming. However, the benefit to great processes is that they are structured and repeatable. With the result of sport psychologist generally is a performance improvement. This methodology has behaviorist roots and formulates performance as an interactive effect of behavior and the environment.[45]


Four key aspects of sport psychology
Social identity is the basis for four specific aspects of sport psychology. These aspects are identified below:[48]


Common areas of study
Listed below are broad areas of research in the field.  This is not a complete list of all topics, but rather, an overview of the types of issues and concepts sport psychologists study. Criticism of the quality, assumptions, and methods of sport psychology stress research has drawn increasing attention,[52] and a flourishing academic debate has evolved regarding the quality of sport research its limitations and future directions.


Commonly used techniques
Below are some of the more common techniques or skills sport psychologists teach to athletes for improving their performance and along with their mental health.


Sport-specific differences
It is beneficial for sport psychologists to understand how athlete personalities systematically vary depending on type of sport played.[153] Research on athlete personalities allows professionals to put in the maximum investment and select specific sports due to a background understanding of the dynamic that they are intervening in. Personality characteristics differ between team versus individual sports, as well as different types of sports.[153]


Exercise psychology
Exercise psychology can be defined as the study of psychological issues and theories related to exercise.[159] Exercise psychology is a sub-discipline within the field of psychology and is typically grouped with sport psychology.  For example, Division 47 of the APA is for exercise and sport psychology, not just one or the other, while organizations like AASP encompass both exercise and sport psychology. However, Division 47 also recognizes that it is important to distinguish between sport and exercise psychology, as any definition that encompasses both disciplines would be too broad to account for the nuances in each.[160]


Mental health in sport psychology
Mental health plays a big role in an athlete's performance.[citation needed] Sport organizations are advised to recognize athlete mental health as not only a core component of a healthy elite sport system but also as a key indicator of the athlete's effectiveness[172]. Some common stressors that affect an athlete's mental health are injuries, underperforming, and environmental factors.[173] With these stressors plus others, the athletes are now prone to deeper mental health issues including anxiety and depression. However, some athletes use the sport as a way of escape, somewhere to hide from the mental issues they are currently facing, whether that be depression and anxiety, or a more complex diagnosis. It is difficult to find evidence pertaining to mental health in athletes because many studies on mental health don't generally focus on mental health in athletes specifically.[174]


Internet :
Contents



Terminology
The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or interwoven.[13] The word Internet was used in 1945 by the United States War Department in a radio operator's manual,[14] and in 1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork.[15] Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks.[16]


History
In the 1960s, computer scientists began developing systems for time-sharing of computer resources.[22][23] J. C. R. Licklider proposed the idea of a universal network while working at Bolt Beranek & Newman and, later, leading the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Research into packet switching, one of the fundamental Internet technologies, started in the work of Paul Baran at RAND in the early 1960s and, independently, Donald Davies at the United Kingdom's National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in 1965.[2][24] After the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 1967, packet switching from the proposed NPL network and dynamic routing concepts proposed by Baran were incorporated into the design of the ARPANET, an experimental resource sharing network proposed by ARPA.[25][26][27]


Governance
The Internet is a global network that comprises many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body. The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain interoperability, the principal name spaces of the Internet are administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including domain names, IP addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet. This role of ICANN distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet.[63]


Infrastructure
The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of routers, media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc. However, as an example of internetworking, many of the network nodes are not necessarily Internet equipment per se, the internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running across heterogeneous hardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers.


Internet Protocol Suite
The Internet standards describe a framework known as the Internet protocol suite (also called TCP/IP, based on the first two components.) This is a suite of protocols that are ordered into a set of four conceptional layers by the scope of their operation, originally documented in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123. At the top is the application layer, where communication is described in terms of the objects or data structures most appropriate for each application. For example, a web browser operates in a client–server application model and exchanges information with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and an application-germane data structure, such as the HyperText Markup Language (HTML).


Applications and services
The Internet carries many applications and services, most prominently the World Wide Web, including social media, electronic mail, mobile applications, multiplayer online games, Internet telephony, file sharing, and streaming media services. Most servers that provide these services are today hosted in data centers, and content is often accessed through high-performance content delivery networks.


Social impact
The Internet has enabled new forms of social interaction, activities, and social associations. This phenomenon has given rise to the scholarly study of the sociology of the Internet. The early Internet left an impact on some writers who used symbolism to write about it, such as describing the Internet as a ""means to connect individuals in a vast invisible net over all the earth.""[95",1.3377056121826172,"Sport_psychology, Internet",0.5710320083440764

What advantages do Field-Reversed Configurations (FRCs) offer over tokamaks in terms of plasma confinement and size?","

Field-Reversed Configurations (FRCs) offer several advantages over tokamaks in terms of plasma confinement and size.

Firstly, FRCs have higher Beta values compared to tokamaks. Beta is a measure of the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure, and higher Beta values indicate that the plasma is more efficiently confined. This means that FRCs can achieve the same power output as tokamaks, but with a smaller volume of plasma. This is a significant advantage, as it would allow for the construction of smaller, more compact fusion reactors, which would be more cost-effective and easier to maintain.

Secondly, FRCs have good plasma stability. Plasma stability is crucial in fusion reactions, as instabilities can cause the plasma to lose its confinement and cool down, making it difficult to achieve and sustain the high temperatures needed for fusion reactions. FRCs have been shown to have good plasma stability, which is essential for achieving and sustaining the high temperatures and densities required for fusion reactions.

Overall, the advantages of FRCs over tokamaks in terms of plasma confinement and size are significant. Their higher Beta values and good plasma stability make them an attractive alternative to tokamaks, and they have the potential to play an important role in the","According to the context, The advantages do Field-Reversed Configurations (FRCs) offer over tokamaks in terms of plasma confinement and size is  instabilities in the plasma that could not be seen on their test equipment.[19]


Later devices
Concerned about the ever-rising cost of the fusion program, Paul McDaniel, director of the Division of Research at the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), decided that the FY 1963 budget should cancel one design of the many being developed at the labs. Tuck had maintained that all researchers should focus only on small systems to prove out the physics, that there was no point in scaling up unless the basics could be demonstrated. Thus, Los Alamos had a large number of small machines, leaving them with no single make-or-break concept. McDaniel would suffer the least political fallout it he canceled one of Los Alamos' programs. This taught Tuck an important lesson; the way to avoid cancellation was to be too big to fail. During testimony to Congress in 1964, he stated ""We resisted the temptation to build huge machines or hire large staffs. This sounds very virtuous, but I have now come to realize this was suicidal"".[25] Tuck, Richard Taschek and Los Alamos' director Norris Bradbury were all convinced the lab needed a major machine.[25]


Toroidal theta
Researchers were convinced that the short confinement times were due to particle losses from the open ends of the reactor. In 1965, Fred Ribe, having replaced Tuck as leader of the Scylla team, began examining practical reactors based on the Scylla layout. They discovered that the system could be improved by using the breeding blanket as a sort of magnetic conductor, which allowed the outer current delivery to be far less intense as it would be magnified as it travelled through the metallic blanket. To make the design work with the given end-loss rates, it would have to be extremely long – calculations suggested that it would have to be 500 metres (1,600 ft) to reach the required 3 millisecond confinement required by the Lawson criterion.[30] This would, in turn, demand an impossibly large power supply.[31]


High-beta stellarator
Amasa Stone Bishop had recently taken over the AEC's fusion management from Arthur Ruark and formed a panel to review the Scylla V proposal, including members of the NRL and GE theta teams. They concluded that there was no convincing evidence that the energy losses being seen were due to end losses, and raised concerns about the effectiveness of dynamic stabilization as well as the possibility that the changing fields it required may simply induce new instabilities. The panel strongly suggested building one more linear machine, 15 metres (49 ft) long, to test the concepts being introduced.[36] Nevertheless, with no other projects, the system was approved, but on the proviso that it be targeted to researching the high-beta regime, not as a prototype power reactor. This marked the beginning of the shift of management of the overall goals of the program to Washington.[37]


Theta vs. tokamak
It was at the Novosibirsk meeting that the Soviet delegation published new results on their tokamak devices that were demonstrating significant improvements over all previous devices. At first the results were dismissed as a lack of proper instrumentation, and a furious debate broke out over whether the results were reliable.[39]


Syllac
In spite of what appeared to be agreement on the wisdom of building a 15 m linear version first, Ribe decided it would be better to instead build Syllac as quickly as possible. To do this, in February 1969 he outlined a plan in which a shorter 10 metres (33 ft) linear device would be built at the same time as a 120 degree sector of Scyllac which would be used to learn how to build the machine as a whole. By 1970 he had further modified these plans to reduce the linear device to only 5 metres (16 ft) with 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) mirrors on either end to improve confinement time.[36]


Linear stops
The failure of Scyllac left the US with only its own tokamak program centered at Princeton and the mirror program at Livermore. Los Alamos attempted one more solution to save the system, re-commissioning Scylla IV with physical stoppers in the ends using light metals. This Scylla IV-P improved the confinement time from 9 to 29 microseconds, a three-fold improvement. But this was nowhere near enough to get into the millisecond range required for a production reactor. After two decades of effort, the best results of the theta program were only a marginal improvement over the results of the original Scylla series.[24]


FRCs
During the 1960s, several teams noticed that their theta experiments would sometimes show improved confinement times. This occurred when the magnetic field was reconfiguring as the external pulse was relaxing back to zero. At the time this behaviour was generally considered undesirable, although it did have the advantage of causing the ion temperature to increase as the fields folded, and it was this action that raised the temperatures to the point where fusion took place.[43]

History
The company was founded in 2013 by David Kirtley, John Slough, Chris Pihl, and George Votroubek.[6] The management team won the 2013 National Cleantech Open Energy Generation competition and awards at the 2014 ARPA-E Future Energy Startup competition,[7] were members of the 2014 Y Combinator program,[8] and were awarded a 2015 ARPA-E ALPHA contract, ""Staged Magnetic Compression of FRC Targets to Fusion Conditions"".[9]


Technology
This system is intended to operate at 1 Hz, injecting plasma, compressing it to fusion conditions, expanding it, and recovering the energy to produce electricity.[13] The pulsed-fusion system that is used is theoretically able to run 24/7 for electricity production. Due to its compact size, the systems may be able to replace current fossil fuel infrastructure without major needs for investment.[14]


Funding
Helion Energy received $7 million in funding from NASA, the United States Department of Energy and the Department of Defense,[31] followed by $1.5 million from the private sector in August 2014, through the seed accelerators Y Combinator and Mithril Capital Management.[32]


Criticism
Retired Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory researcher Daniel Jassby mentioned Helion Energy in a letter included in the American Physical Society newsletter Physics & Society (April 2019) as being among fusion start-ups allegedly practicing ""voodoo fusion"" rather than legitimate science. He noted that the company is one of several that has continually claimed ""power in 5 to 10 years, but almost all have apparently never produced a single D-D fusion reaction"".[38] However, Helion published peer-reviewed research demonstrating D-D neutron production as early as 2011[20] and according to the independent JASON review team, VENTI, a sub-scale prototype Helion developed partially for the ALPHA program, achieved initial results of 8 × 1022 ions/m3, 4 × 10−5 seconds energy confinement time and a temperature of 2 keV in 2018.[23] In 2020 Helion was the first private company to successfully demonstrate thermonuclear fusion plasmas exceeding 9 keV with expected D-D fusion reactions and neutrons[39] and a triple product greater than 1 × 1020 keV·s/m3",0.9889376163482666,"Theta_pinch, Helion_Energy",0.6325337611229137

What is the approximate distance between Stac Lee and Hirta, the main island in the St Kilda group?","

According to the provided context, Stac Lee is approximately 7 kilometres (4 miles) north east of Hirta, the main island in the St Kilda group.","According to the context, The the approximate distance between Stac Lee and Hirta, the main island in the St Kilda group is  3 by 3 metres (10 by 10 ft), two or more smaller cells and a forecourt formed by two curved or horn-shaped walls. Again, nothing like them exists anywhere else in Europe, and their original use is unknown.[134][135] Also in Gleann Mòr is Taigh na Banaghaisgeich, the ""Amazon's House"". As Martin (1703) reported, many St Kilda tales are told about this female warrior.


Fauna and flora
St Kilda is a breeding ground for many important seabird species. One of the world's largest colonies of northern gannets, totalling 30,000 pairs, amount to 24 per cent of the global population. There are 49,000 breeding pairs of Leach's petrels, up to 90 per cent of the European population; 136,000 pairs of Atlantic puffins, about 30 per cent of the UK total breeding population, and 67,000 northern fulmar pairs, about 13 per cent of the UK total.[162] Dùn is home to the largest colony of fulmars in Britain. Before 1828, St Kilda was their only UK breeding ground, but they have since spread and established colonies elsewhere, such as Fowlsheugh.[163] The last great auk (Pinguinus impennis) seen in Britain was killed on Stac an Armin in July 1840.[4] Unusual behaviour by St Kilda's bonxies was recorded in 2007 during research into recent falls in the Leach's petrel population. Using night-vision gear, ecologists observed the skuas hunting petrels at night, a remarkable strategy for a seabird.[164] The St Kilda archipelago has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International for its seabird colonies.[165]


Nature conservation
On his death on 14 August 1956, the Marquess of Bute's will bequeathed the archipelago to the National Trust for Scotland provided they accepted the offer within six months. After much soul-searching, the executive committee agreed to do so in January 1957. The slow renovation and conservation of the village began, much of it undertaken by summer volunteer work parties.[175] In addition, scientific research began on the feral Soay sheep population and other aspects of the natural environment. In 1957 the area was designated a national nature reserve.[176]


List_of_islands_of_Scotland :
Contents



Demographics
The 2011 census records 94 Scottish islands as having a usually resident population, of which 89 are offshore islands. There are however various complications with both the definitions of an ""island"" and occasional habitation; and the National Records of Scotland also list a further 17 islands that were inhabited in 2001 but not in 2011, or are ""included in the NRS statistical geography for inhabited islands but had no usual residents at the time of either the 2001 or 2011 censuses"".[13] There are a small number of other islands that are evidently inhabited but which are not recorded in this list.[Note 2]


Legislation
In July 2013, the Scottish Government made the Lerwick Declaration, indicating an intention to decentralise power to the three island council areas of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles and later that year made a commitment to do so.[37] In 2017 an Islands bill was introduced to make ""island proofing"" (including for uninhabited islands) a statutory requirement for public bodies. The Bill completed Stage 1 on 8 February 2018.[38]


Larger islands
This is a list of Scottish islands that either have an area greater than 40 hectares (approximately 100 acres) and/or are inhabited. The main groups, from Haswell-Smith (2004), in many cases provide a more useful guide to location than local authority areas. These groups are: Firth of Clyde, Islay, Firth of Lorn, Mull, Small Isles, Skye, Lewis and Harris, Uists and Barra, St Kilda, Orkney, Shetland and Firth of Forth. In a few cases where the island is part of either a recognisable smaller group or an archipelago, or is located away from the main groups, an archipelago, local authority or other descriptive name is used instead. ""F"" designates a freshwater island.


Freshwater islands
There are numerous other freshwater islands, of which the more notable include Lochindorb Castle Island, Loch Leven Castle Island, St Serf's Inch, and Inchmahome, each of which have played an important part in Scottish history.


Smaller offshore islands
This is a continuing list of uninhabited Scottish islands smaller than 40 hectares in size.


Small archipelagos
There are various small archipelagos which may be better known than the larger islands they contain. These include:


Former islands
The following is a list of places which were formerly islands, but which are no longer so due to silting up, harbour building etc.


Bridged islands
Many of Scotland's islands are connected to the mainland and/or other islands by bridge or causeway. Although some people consider them no longer to be islands, they are generally treated as such.


Tidal islands and tombolos
There are a large number of small tidal islands in Scotland. The more notable ones include:


Complex islands
There are a number of offshore islands that defy easy classification.


Castle islands
There are several small Scottish islands that are dominated by a castle or other fortification. The castle is often better known than the island, and the islands are often tidal or bridged. Due to their picturesque nature some of them are well known from postcards and films. Examples are:


Holy islands
A large number of the islands of Scotland have some kind of culdee/church connection, and/or are dominated by a church. The more notable include:


Islands named after people
This is a list of islands, which are known to be named after someone. In some cases such as North Ronaldsay this status may not be obvious (it isn't named after a ""Ronald"", unlike South Ronaldsay). This list omits names such as Hildasay, where the person in question is mythological, or Ailsa Craig, where the individual in question is not known, and also Colonsay & Egilsay where the derivation is disputed.


Places called ""island"" etc. that are not islands
Some places in Scotland with names including ""isle"" or ""island"" are not islands. They include:


Stacks
It has been estimated that there are about 275 sea stacks in Scotland of which circa 110 are located around the coasts of Shetland.[66] The highest are Stac an Armin and Stac Lee,[67] St Kilda. In July 1967 15 million people watched the climbing of the Old Man of Hoy live on BBC television.[68] However, for many of the remoter stacks especially in Shetland, there is no record of there having been any attempt by rock climbers to ascend them.[69]


Crannogs
Crannogs are prehistoric artificial islands created in lochs. There are several hundred sites in Scotland. Today, crannogs typically appear as small, circular islands, between 10 and 30 metres (30–100 feet)",2.014655351638794,"St_Kilda,_Scotland, List_of_islands_of_Scotland",0.5769090948172296

What geological feature near Hrad Vallis may have contributed to the formation of the channel?","

Based on the context provided, it is likely that the geological feature near Hrad Vallis that contributed to the formation of the channel is the presence of hot subsurface molten rock from the nearby volcano, Elysium Mons. When this molten rock came close to the water ice beneath the surface of Mars, it may have caused the ice to melt, producing large amounts of liquid water and mud. This process could have created a significant amount of fluid that flowed through the channel, carving out the landscape and shaping the Hrad Vallis feature.

The proximity of Hrad Vallis to Elysium Mons, a large volcano, suggests a strong connection between the two geological features. The heat generated by the volcano's subsurface activity could have played a crucial role in melting the ice and creating the conditions necessary for the formation of the channel. This process would have required the presence of water ice beneath the surface, which is consistent with the context provided.

Therefore, the geological feature near Hrad Vallis that may have contributed to the formation of the channel is the hot subsurface molten rock from Elysium Mons, which interacted with the water ice to produce the liquid water and mud that carved out the channel.","According to the context, The geological feature near Hrad Vallis may have contributed to the formation of the channel is  Hadriaca Patera, so it is thought to have received water when hot magma melted huge amounts of ice in the frozen ground.[2]  The partially circular depressions on the left side of the channel in the adjacent image suggests that groundwater sapping also contributed water.[38]


Dust devil tracks
Many areas on Mars, including the Hellas quadrangle, experience the passage of giant dust devils.  A thin coating of fine bright dust covers most of the martian surface.  When a dust devil goes by it blows away the coating and exposes the underlying dark surface.  Dust devils have been seen from the ground and from orbiting spacecraft.  They have even blown the dust off of the solar panels of the two Rovers on Mars, thereby greatly extending their lives.[39]  The twin Rovers were designed to last for 3 months, instead they have lasted more than five years.  The pattern of the tracks have been shown to change every few months.[40]  A study that combined data from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) and the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) found that some large dust devils on Mars have a diameter of 700 meters and last at least 26 minutes.[41]  Some dust devils are taller than the average tornado on the Earth.[42]


Evidence for possible recent liquid water
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter discovered changes on the wall of Penticton Crater between 1999 and 2004.  One interpretation of the changes was that they were caused by water flowing on the surface.[43]  A further analysis, published about a year later, revealed that the deposit could have been caused by gravity moving material down slope (a landslide).  The slope where the deposit was sighted was close to the stability limits of dry, unconsolidated materials.[44]


Other craters
Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits.  As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak.[45] The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact.[46]  Sometimes craters will display layers.  Craters can show us what lies deep under the surface.


Glacial features
Glaciers, loosely defined as patches of currently or recently flowing ice, are thought to be present across large but restricted areas of the modern Martian surface, and are inferred to have been more widely distributed at times in the past.[49][50] Lobate convex features on the surface known as viscous flow features and lobate debris aprons, which show the characteristics of non-Newtonian flow, are now almost unanimously regarded as true glaciers.[49][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58]


Channels
There is enormous evidence that water once flowed in river valleys on Mars.[60][61]  Images of curved channels have been seen in images from Mars spacecraft dating back to the early 1970s with the Mariner 9 orbiter.[62][63][64][65]  Indeed, a study published in June 2017, calculated that the volume of water needed to carve all the channels on Mars was even larger than the proposed ocean that the planet may have had.  Water was probably recycled many times from the ocean to rainfall around Mars.[66][67]


Layers
Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. Rock can form layers in a variety of ways.  Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers.[68]
A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars.[69]


Honeycomb terrain
These relatively flat-lying ""cells"" appear to have concentric layers or bands, similar to a honeycomb.

What is the state of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) when it is dissolved in an aqueous solution, according to the provided context?","

According to the provided context, when hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is dissolved in an aqueous solution, it is partially ionized, meaning that it exists in an equilibrium between un-ionized molecules and constituent ions. This indicates that H2S is not fully dissociated into its constituent ions, but rather exists in a state where some of the molecules remain intact while others break down into ions.

In other words, in an aqueous solution, H2S exists in a dynamic equilibrium between its molecular form (H2S) and its ionic form (H+ and HS-), with the two forms constantly interconverting. This is characteristic of a weak electrolyte, which is a substance that only partially dissociates into ions when dissolved in a solvent, in this case, water.

Therefore, the state of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) when it is dissolved in an aqueous solution is partially ionized, with a mixture of molecular and ionic forms coexisting in equilibrium.","According to the context, The the state of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) when it is dissolved in an aqueous solution, according to the provided context is  colorless chalcogen-hydride gas",3.0933961868286133,"Hydrogen_sulfide, Formaldehyde",0.7027756658010951

Where did Ameriks earn his A.B. and Ph.D. degrees, and under whose direction did he write his thesis?","

Ameriks earned his A.B. and Ph.D. degrees from Yale University. He wrote his thesis under the direction of Karsten Harries.","According to the context, is  medieval Europe as a license to teach (Latin: licentia docendi) at a medieval university.[2] Its roots can be traced to the early church, when the term ""doctor"" referred to the Apostles, church fathers and other Christian authorities who taught and interpreted the Bible.[2] The right to grant a licentia docendi was originally reserved to the church which required the applicant to pass a test, take an Oath of allegiance and pay a fee. The Third Council of the Lateran of 1179 guaranteed the access — now largely free of charge — of all able applicants, who were, however, still tested for aptitude by the ecclesiastic scholastic.[3] This right remained a bone of contention between church authorities and the slowly emancipating universities, but was granted by the pope to the University of Paris in 1213, when it became a universal license to teach (licentia ubiquie docendi).[3] However, while the licentia continued to hold more prestige than the bachelor's degree (Baccalaureus), it was eventually positioned below the Magister and the doctorate, which became the only titles with which one could teach.[3]


Doctor as a noun
Throughout much of the academic world, the term Doctor refers to someone who has earned a doctoral degree (highest degree) from a university.[63] This is normally the Doctor of Philosophy, abbreviated PhD (sometimes Ph.D. in North America) from the Latin Philosophiae Doctor or DPhil from its English name,[64] or equivalent research doctorates at level 8 of the International Standard Classification of Education 2011 classifications (ISCED 2011) or level 6 of the ISCED 1997 classifications. Beyond academia (but specifically in the anglophone world, Italy, and France), Doctor as a noun normally refers to a medical practitioner,[63] who would usually hold a qualification at level 7 of ISCED 2011/level 5 of ISCED 1997 such as the British MBBS or the American MD or DO.[65]


Forms of address
When addressing several people, each of whom holds a doctoral title, one may use the plural contraction ""Drs"" (or ""Drs."" in American English) – or in some languages (for example, German) ""Dres."" (from the Latin doctores) may be used – for example, instead of Dr. Miller and Dr. Rubinstein: Drs. Miller and Rubinstein. When referring to relatives with the same surname the form ""The Doctors Smith"" can be used. The abbreviation Drs. can also refer to doctorandus, a Dutch academic title that was replaced with the master title with the introduction of the master system.


Usage by medical practitioners in the UK and culturally-related countries
In the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Trinidad and Tobago, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Ghana, and other countries whose cultures were recently linked to the UK, the title Dr is generally used both for those who hold doctoral degrees and for registered medical practitioners. History has dictated the use of the courtesy title Dr by physicians and general practitioners.[69] However, surgeons do not use the title of Dr and, due to the origins of surgery with the barber surgeons, instead use Mr, Mrs, Ms, Miss, etc. This custom applies to surgeons of any grade who have passed the appropriate exams and is not the exclusive province of consultant-level surgeons. In recent times, other surgically orientated specialists, such as gynaecologists, have also adopted these prefixes. A surgeon who is also a professor is usually known as ""Professor"" and, similarly, a surgeon who has been ennobled, knighted, created a baronet or appointed a dame uses the corresponding title (Lord, Sir, Dame). Physicians, on the other hand, when they pass their ""MRCP(UK)"" examinations, or equivalent, do not drop Dr but retain it, even as consultants. The status and rank of consultant surgeons, addressed as ""Mister"" or ""Ms."", and consultant physicians, addressed as ""Doctor"", is equivalent.

With n=2 agents, an envy-free division can be achieved using a simple algorithm called ""divide and choose"". The algorithm works as follows:

1. One agent divides the cake into two pieces, and the other agent chooses the piece they prefer.

This algorithm requires only two queries:

The primary reason for recommending the nonprofit organization operating the Illinois Channel to be independent of affiliations with other organizations was to ensure that every institution of higher education in Illinois would feel it had an equal opportunity to have their public affairs programming televised. This recommendation was made to promote fairness and equity, allowing all institutions to have a level playing field in terms of accessing the channel's resources and broadcasting their content.

By being free of affiliations with other organizations, including the University of Illinois Springfield, the nonprofit organization operating the Illinois Channel would be able to maintain its independence and impartiality. This would prevent any perception of bias or favoritism towards certain institutions, and ensure that the channel's programming is representative of the diverse perspectives and interests of all institutions of higher education in Illinois.

There were a variety of reasons for this failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation. Additionally, the power of the League was limited by the United States' refusal to join.[224]


Demise and legacy
As the situation in Europe escalated into war, the Assembly transferred enough power to the Secretary General on 30 September 1938 and 14 December 1939 to allow the League to continue to exist legally and carry on reduced operations.[246] The headquarters of the League, the Palace of Nations, remained unoccupied for nearly six years until the Second World War ended.[247]


League of Nations archives
The League of Nations archives is a collection of the League's records and documents. It consists of approximately 15 million pages of content dating from the inception of the League of Nations in 1919 extending through its dissolution in 1946. It is located at the United Nations Office at Geneva.[257] In 2017, the UN Library & Archives Geneva launched the Total Digital Access to the League of Nations Archives Project (LONTAD), with the intention of preserving, digitizing, and providing online access to the League of Nations archives. It was completed in 2022.[258]


United_Nations_General_Assembly :
Contents



History
The first session of the UN General Assembly was convened on 10 January 1946 in the Methodist Central Hall in London and included representatives of 51 nations.[5] Until moving to its permanent home in Manhattan in 1951, the Assembly convened at the former New York City Pavilion of the 1939 New York World's Fair in Flushing, New York.[6] On November 29, 1947, the Assembly voted to adopt the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine at this venue.[7]


Membership
All 193 members of the United Nations are members of the General Assembly, with the addition of the Holy See and Palestine as observer states as well as the European Union (since 1974). Further, the United Nations General Assembly may grant observer status to an international organization or entity, which entitles the entity to participate in the work of the United Nations General Assembly, though with limitations.


Agenda
The agenda for each session is planned up to seven months in advance and begins with the release of a preliminary list of items to be included in the provisional agenda.[12] This is refined into a provisional agenda 60 days before the opening of the session. After the session begins, the final agenda is adopted in a plenary meeting which allocates the work to the various main committees, who later submit reports back to the Assembly for adoption by consensus or by vote.


Resolutions
The General Assembly votes on many resolutions brought forth by sponsoring states. These are generally statements symbolizing the sense of the international community about an array of world issues.[16] Most General Assembly resolutions are not enforceable as a legal or practical matter, because the General Assembly lacks enforcement powers with respect to most issues.[17] The General Assembly has the authority to make final decisions in some areas such as the United Nations budget.[18]


Budget
The General Assembly also approves the budget of the United Nations and decides how much money each member state must pay to run the organization.[21]


Elections
The General Assembly is entrusted in the United Nations Charter with electing members to various organs within the United Nations system. The procedure for these elections can be found in Section 15 of the Rules of Procedure for the General Assembly. The most important elections for the General Assembly include those for the upcoming President of the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Human Rights Council, the International Court of Justice, judges of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal, and United Nations Appeals Tribunal. Most elections are held annually, with the exception of the election of judges to the ICJ, which happens triennially.[24][25]


Sessions
The General Assembly meets annually in a regular session that opens on the third Tuesday of September, and runs until the following September. Sessions are held at United Nations Headquarters in New York unless changed by the General Assembly by a majority vote.[24][32]


Subsidiary organs
The General Assembly subsidiary organs are divided into five categories: committees (30 total, six main), commissions (six), boards (seven), councils (four) and panels (one), working groups, and ""other.""


Seating
Countries are seated alphabetically in the General Assembly according to English translations of the countries' names. The country which occupies the front-most left position is determined annually by the secretary-general via ballot draw. The remaining countries follow alphabetically after it.[48]


Reform and UNPA
On 21 March 2005, Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented a report, In Larger Freedom, that criticized the General Assembly for focusing so much on consensus that it was passing watered-down resolutions reflecting ""the lowest common denominator of widely different opinions.""[49] He also criticized the Assembly for trying to address too broad an agenda, instead of focusing on ""the major substantive issues of the day, such as international migration and the long-debated comprehensive convention on terrorism."" Annan recommended streamlining the General Assembly's agenda, committee structure, and procedures; strengthening the role and authority of its president; enhancing the role of civil society; and establishing a mechanism to review the decisions of its committees, in order to minimize unfunded mandates and micromanagement of the United Nations Secretariat. Annan reminded UN members of their responsibility to implement reforms, if they expect to realize improvements in UN effectiveness.[50]


Sidelines of the General Assembly
The annual session of the United Nations General Assembly is accompanied by independent meetings between world leaders, better known as meetings taking place on the sidelines of the Assembly meeting. The diplomatic congregation has also since evolved into a week attracting wealthy and influential individuals from around the world to New York City to address various agendas, ranging from humanitarian and environmental to business and political",1.3393545150756836,"League_of_Nations, United_Nations_General_Assembly",0.5232607930582261

What role do student politicians play in Venezuelan society, and how does their influence compare to that of students in other countries?","

Student politicians in Venezuela play a significant and unique role in the country's society, wielding a substantial amount of influence that is unparalleled in many other countries. Unlike in many nations where student activism is often marginalized or relegated to the fringes of political discourse, in Venezuela, student politicians are a force to be reckoned with. They have a long history of shaping public opinion, driving social change, and even influencing national policies.

In Venezuela, student politicians have been instrumental in mobilizing public support for various causes, often using their activism as a springboard for future political careers. Many student leaders have gone on to become prominent lawmakers, ministers, and even presidents, illustrating the significant impact they can have on the country's political landscape. This phenomenon is partly due to the country's historical context, where student movements have played a crucial role in shaping the nation's political destiny.

Compared to other countries, the influence of student politicians in Venezuela is remarkable. In many nations, student activism is often limited to campus-based issues or specific causes, without necessarily translating into broader political clout. In contrast, Venezuelan student politicians have managed to transcend campus boundaries, engaging with national issues and shaping the country's political agenda.

Several factors contribute to the significant influence of student politicians in Venezuela.

Mammon (Aramaic: מָמוֹנָא, māmōnā) in the New Testament is commonly thought to mean money, material wealth, or any entity that promises wealth, and is associated with the greedy pursuit of gain. The Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke both quote Jesus using the word in a phrase often rendered in English as ""You cannot serve both God and mammon.""


Etymology
The word Mammon comes into English from post-classical Latin mammona 'wealth', used most importantly in the Vulgate Bible (along with Tertullian's mammonas and pseudo-Jerome's mammon). This was in turn borrowed from Hellenistic Greek μαμωνᾶς, which appears in the New Testament, borrowed from Aramaic מָמוֹנָא  māmōnā, an emphatic form of the word māmōn 'wealth, profit',[1] perhaps specifically from the Syriac dialect. The spelling μαμμωνᾷ refers to ""a Syrian deity, god of riches; Hence riches, wealth""; μαμωνᾶς is transliterated from Aramaic [ממון] and also means ""wealth"".[2] However, it is not clear what the earlier history of the Aramaic form was.[1][3] The word may have been present throughout the Canaanite languages: the word is unknown in Old Testament Hebrew, but has been found in the Qumran documents;[4] post-biblical Hebrew attests to māmōn; and, according to Augustine of Hippo, Punic included the word mammon 'profit'.[1] It has been suggested that the Aramaic word māmōn was a loanword from Mishnaic Hebrew ממון (mamôn) meaning money,[5][6][7] wealth,[8] or possessions;[9] although it may also have meant ""that in which one trusts"".[3]


Personifications
Gregory of Nyssa also asserted that Mammon was another name for Beelzebub.[15]


In various countries
The 1409 Lollard manuscript titled Lanterne of Light associated Mammon with the deadly sin of the greed.


In literature
The 1409 Lollard manuscript titled Lanterne of Light associated Mammon with the deadly sin of the greed.


In popular culture

Benjamin_Zephaniah :
Contents



Early life and education
Benjamin Obadiah Iqbal Springer was born on 15 April 1958,[1][2][3] in the Handsworth district of Birmingham, England, where he was also raised.[4][5] He referred to this area as the ""Jamaican capital of Europe"".[6] The son of parents who had migrated from the Caribbean – Oswald Springer, a Barbadian postman, and Leneve (née Honeyghan),[7] a Jamaican nurse who came to Britain in 1956 and worked for the National Health Service[8] – he had a total of seven younger siblings, including his twin sister, Velda.[2][3][9]


Written work and poetry
Having moved to London, Zephaniah became actively involved in a workers' co-operative in Stratford, which led to the publication of his first book of poetry, Pen Rhythm (Page One Books, 1980). He had earlier been turned down by other publishers who did not believe there would be an audience for his work, and ""they didn't understand it because it was supposed to be performed"".[22] Three editions of Pen Rhythm were published. Zephaniah said that his mission was to fight the dead image of poetry in academia, and to ""take [it] everywhere"" to people who do not read books, so he turned poetry readings into concert-like performances,[16] sometimes with The Benjamin Zephaniah Band.[16][23]


Acting and media appearances
Zephaniah made minor appearances in several television programmes in the 1980s and 1990s, including
The Comic Strip Presents... (1988), EastEnders (1993), The Bill (1994),  and Crucial Tales (1996).[49] In 1990, he appeared in the film Farendj, directed by Sabine Prenczina and starring Tim Roth.[50]


Music
In 1982, Zephaniah released the album Rasta, which featured the Wailers' first recording since the death of Bob Marley as well as a tribute to the political prisoner (later to become South African president) Nelson Mandela. The album gained Zephaniah international prestige[57] and topped the Yugoslavian pop charts.[11][57] It was because of this recording that he was introduced to Mandela, and in 1996, Mandela requested that Zephaniah host the president's Two Nations Concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London.[19][58]


Views
Zephaniah was connected with – and served as patron for – many organizations that aligned with his beliefs.[60][61]


Achievements and recognition
In 1998, Zephaniah was a winner of the BBC Young Playwrights Festival Award with his first ever radio play Hurricane Dub.[1][27][91]


Personal life
Zephaniah lived for many years in East London; however, in 2008, he began dividing his time between a village near Spalding, Lincolnshire, and Beijing in China.[107] He was a keen language learner and studied Mandarin Chinese",0.9338030815124512,"Mammon, Benjamin_Zephaniah",0.5424657004664507
