Background
Guam, at 212 square miles (543 square kilometers), is the largest island of the Marianas, with a length of 32 miles (52 km) and a width ranging from 12 miles (19.31 km) to four miles (6.44 km) at different points of the island.[2][11]It had been a United States possession since its capture from Spain in 1898 until it was captured by the Japanese on 10 December 1941, following the attack on Pearl Harbor. During the Japanese occupation of Guam, it was not as heavily fortified as the other Mariana Islands such as Saipan that had been Japanese possessions since the end of World War I. But by 1944, Guam had a large Japanese garrison.


Opposing forces
 United States
US Fifth Fleet
Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, USN
Southern Attack Force (Task Force 53) 
Vice Admiral Richard L. Conolly, USN
Expeditionary Troops
Lieutenant General Holland M. Smith, USMC
Approx. 48,200 officers and enlisted
III Marine Amphibious Corps
Major General Roy S. Geiger, USMC


Battle
Before landing, U.S. forces sought to ensure both air and naval superiority. A total of 274 ships, which fired 44,978 shots from 2-inch and 5-inch guns, supported the landing. In addition, 13 aircraft carriers participated in the air raid, and 4,283 bombs (weighing a total of 1,310 tons) were dropped from 18 to 20 July, the day before the landings. The heavy bombardment burned all the palm trees on the beach and destroyed every building that could be seen. Experience gained by the Japanese from the invasion of Saipan was used to try to mitigate the effects of the bombardment. Despite this, the bombardment far exceeded the expectations of the defending forces which were dug in along the coast as they were on Saipan. Many of the bases and guard towers were destroyed. However, artillery pieces entrenched in dense forests, caves, trenches and locations four kilometers or more from the coast were able to escape destruction and became a source of heavy Japanese resistance. Guam, ringed by reefs, cliffs, and heavy surf, presents a formidable challenge for any attacker.[2]: 14  Underwater Demolition Teams reconnoitered the beaches and removed obstacles from 14 to 17 July.[2]: 43 


Aftermath
A few Japanese soldiers held out in the jungle after the fighting on Guam.[2]: 87  On 8 December 1945 three U.S. Marines were ambushed and killed. Sergeant Masashi Itō surrendered on 23 May 1960 after the last of his companions was captured. On 24 January 1972 Sergeant Shoichi Yokoi was discovered by hunters on the island. He had lived alone in a cave for 28 years, near Talofofo Falls.

Background
Guam is the southernmost part of the Mariana Islands in the Pacific Ocean. It is the largest of the islands, with an area of 225 square miles. Guam's interior is rugged, with heavy tropical forests in the north of the island and wooded hills in the south. Much of the island's coastline is edged with coral reefs and cliffs, though beaches suitable for landing troops exist in the center of the west coast.[1]: 14  Guam has a tropical climate, though December forms part of the dry season.[1]: 13 


Prelude
Japanese plans for the Pacific War included capturing Guam in the war's early days. From March 1941, Japanese aircraft flew photo reconnaissance sorties over the island.[1]: 18  Plans for the invasion of the island were completed in September 1941",1.0137488842010498,"Battle_of_Guam_(1944), Battle_of_Guam_(1941)",0.7
