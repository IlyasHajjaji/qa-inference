When was the prototype of the ST Aero MAV-1 unveiled at the Asian Aerospace exhibition?","

The prototype of the ST Aero MAV-1 was unveiled at the Asian Aerospace exhibition in 2004."," May 27, 2022, through Interscope Records and Paramount Music.[110][111] It was promoted by two singles, ""Hold My Hand"" by Lady Gaga and ""I Ain't Worried"" by OneRepublic. From the first film, the score also incorporates elements of the original ""Top Gun Anthem"",[112][113] and the song ""Danger Zone"", composed by Giorgio Moroder and sung by Kenny Loggins.[114]


Marketing
The film's first teaser trailer premiered during a surprise appearance by Cruise at San Diego Comic-Con on July 18, 2019.[115][116] The first trailer received high praise from fans, with many lauding the return of the series and some comparing it to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.[117] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that some fans noticed that the flag of the Republic of China (the flag used by the government of the Republic of China based on the island of Taiwan) and the Flag of Japan were missing from the flight jacket of Cruise's character and accused Paramount of removing it to appease China-based co-financier Tencent Pictures.[118] However, the Republic of China and Japanese flags were later restored, as Tencent would end up pulling out of the production, leading to them being uncredited in the final film and, instead, the producers chose to not release the movie in China.[119][120] The second trailer was released in December 2019,[121] and a new Snapchat filter for the film was introduced by Paramount, to engage ""young-generation audiences"".[122]


Release
Top Gun: Maverick was released theatrically by Paramount Pictures in the United States on May 27, 2022, with advance screenings starting the day before.[140] It was originally scheduled to be released on July 12, 2019, but was delayed to June 26, 2020, in order to shoot several complex action sequences.[141] By March 2020, Paramount moved the film up two days early on June 24, 2020,[142] and it was then moved to December 23 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic declared by the World Health Organization.[143][144] On July 23, 2020, the film was delayed again to July 2, 2021, due in part to scheduling conflicts with Cruise, as well as the recent delays of Mulan and Tenet due to the rise of COVID-19 cases,[145] and was further delayed to November 19, 2021,[146] before finalizing the May 2022 release date.[140]


Reception
Top Gun: Maverick grossed $718.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $777 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.496 billion.[4][5] The film became the highest-grossing film of Cruise's career on June 17, 2022, after crossing $800 million worldwide.[166] On June 26, the film crossed $1 billion, becoming the second film to do so during the pandemic era.[167][168] It is the second-highest-grossing film released in 2022 (behind Avatar: The Way of Water).[169] Sonny Bunch, writing for The Washington Post, argued that the film's financial success along with that of Spider-Man: No Way Home demonstrates that securing a theatrical release in China is not mandatory for a Hollywood film to be profitable.[120] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $391.1 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it second on their list of 2022's ""Most Valuable Blockbusters"".[1]


Lawsuit
In June 2022, the family of Israeli author Ehud Yonay, who wrote the California article ""Top Guns"" in May 1983 that inspired the first film, sued Paramount for copyright infringement over the release of Top Gun: Maverick and sought damages as well as an injunction against the film's distribution. Jerry Bruckheimer produced the original film, whose screenplay was written by Jim Cash (died 2000) and Jack Epps Jr.; all three men participated in the sequel.[210] According to the lawsuit, Paramount had obtained exclusive film rights to Yonay's article but ignored the 35-year copyright law, wherein the rights reverted to Yonay's widow Shosh and son Yuval in January 2020 after the writer's death in 2012.[211]


Future
In May 2022, Teller revealed that he had been pitching a sequel, which would be tentatively titled Top Gun: Rooster and centered on his character, to Paramount Pictures.[216] By July of the same year, he stated that he has been having ongoing discussions with Cruise regarding a sequel.[217] In January 2024, it was reported that a sequel is in development.[218][219]
